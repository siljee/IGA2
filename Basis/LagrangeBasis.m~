function L = LagrangeBasis(p, t, x)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Constructs p+1 Lagrange polynomials, defined by t
%
% Input:
%    p        - The polynomial order of the p+1 basis functions.
%               (p = 0: constant, p=1: linear, p=2: quadratic etc.)
%    x        - A vector of evaluation points in Bernstein parameter 
%               space.
%
% Output:
%    B        - Array of Bernstein polynomials. One basis in each row,
%               defined on points x, one in each column.
