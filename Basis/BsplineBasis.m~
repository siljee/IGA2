function N = BsplineBasis(knotVec, p, x)
% Constructs n univariate B-spline basis functions utilizing Cox-de Boor
% recursion formula.
%
% Input:
%    knotVec  - The vector of knots. i = 1,2,...,n+p+1. Knot values can
%               be repeated.
%    p        - The polynomial order of the n basis functions.
%               (p = 0: constant, p=1: linear, p=2: quadratic etc.)
%    x        - A vector of values in parameter space where the basis
%               functions should be evaluated.
%
% Output:
%    N        - Array of B-spline basis functions. Each tow contain one
%               basis function evaluated on x.
